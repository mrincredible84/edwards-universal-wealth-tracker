# 🏦 Edwards Universal Wealth Tracker

## 📖 The Story
This project was born out of a simple goal: to replace a tangible, handwritten system with a digital tool that keeps the complexities of managing personal finances simple. I built this because I love my family and wanted to create a clear roadmap for our financial legacy—and eventually, a tool that friends and other families can use to find their own financial footing.
